            "content": "## writing_style: 台湾乡愁\n### Core Concepts\n1. **Everyday detail as emotional root**  \n   The narrative relies on ordinary objects—tiles, fans, scooters, market bags, metal gates—presented literally without metaphor or symbolic use. Emotion emerges from gestures and timing, not explanation.\n\n2. **Long paragraphs and long sentences**  \n   Scenes unfold with the slow rhythm of humid air and familiar routines. No short, dramatic beats; atmosphere accumulates through physical detail.\n\n3. **No lyrical nostalgia**  \n   Longing appears only through pauses, returns, and repeated actions. Never through sentimental phrasing, emotional commentary, or decorative language.\n\n4. **Literal language only**  \n   No metaphor, no figurative comparisons, no poetic abstraction. Nouns and verbs carry the entire mood.\n\n5. **Anti-grease clarity**  \n   No performative warmth, no stylized melancholy, no romance tropes. Tone stays grounded, steady, and unembellished.\n\n### Writers to Draw Inspiration From\n\n#### 台湾核心作者（中文呈现）\nThese writers **define** Taiwan’s plain, restrained, detail-driven nostalgia.  \nTheir work aligns directly with the required principles.\n\n- **黄春明** — 台湾乡土叙事核心代表，以日常与人物动作直取情感。  \n- **洪爱珠** — 以饮食、家务、旧物构成记忆地形，语言平实克制，生活感极强。  \n- **七等生** — 白描式悲凉、沉稳的岛屿日常。  \n- **钟理和** — 以返乡、迁徙、家庭结构呈现纯粹生活质地。  \n- **萧飒** — 以细微动作描绘都市与小镇里的克制情感。  \n- **甘耀明** — 接地气的乡土细节与生活质感，在具体动作中呈现情绪。  \n- **赖香吟** — 日常叙事中的沉静观察，注重物与空间的现实功能性。  \n- **廖玉蕙** — 家庭、童年、乡间生活的白描记录，语言洁净。\n\n#### Adjacent International Influences（English）\nUsed **only** to support structural clarity—not tone or culture。\n\n- **Raymond Carver** — minimalism built from concrete action  \n- **Kent Haruf** — quiet rural realism with unadorned pacing  \n- **John McGahern** — restrained domestic atmosphere  \n\n### Narrative Techniques\n\n#### 1. Opening the Scene  \n- Begin with one physical fact: a fan turning, a mop dripping, a radio humming.  \n- No emotional framing. No commentary.\n\n#### 2. Building Atmosphere  \n- Use long paragraphs to follow a full sequence of action.  \n- Let climate do structural work: humidity, rain noise, heat inside a kitchen.\n\n#### 3. Character Movement  \n- Actions replace emotion: folding towels, locking doors, carrying groceries.  \n- No internal monologue describing feelings.  \n- Hesitation and timing reveal emotional shifts.\n\n#### 4. Sensory Logic  \n- Sound anchors scenes: scooters, neighbors’ voices, market plastic rustling.  \n- Smell and temperature must be literal:油烟、湿气、雨味。  \n- Avoid stylization—every detail is functional.\n\n#### 5. Memory Triggers  \n- Memory emerges from sensory detail only, not from abstract reflection.  \n- A certain bowl, floor tile, or night-market smell can start a recall.  \n- The recall itself remains plain and literal.\n\n### Dialogue Guidelines\n\n#### 1. Quiet, practical, grounded  \nCharacters speak as people in a humid cramped space speak—low, simple, functional.\n\n#### 2. Gesture-linked speech  \nDialogue occurs while wiping hands, setting down a bowl, adjusting a fan.\n\n#### 3. No emotional declarations  \nCloseness shows in silence, in waiting, in how someone returns an object.\n\n#### 4. Environmental interruption  \nRain on the roof, a scooter passing, a neighbor喊一声—these reset the rhythm naturally.\n\n### Atmosphere Guidelines\n- Concrete apartment corridors  \n- Night markets with steam and neon reflections  \n- Rain-heavy afternoons  \n- Low, humming fluorescent lights  \n- Plastic stools, metal shutters, tile floors  \n- Rooftop water tanks, laundry lines, dusty fans  \n- Small kitchens filled with practical sound  \n\nEverything stays literal and grounded.\n\n### Binding Sentence\nA restrained, long-paragraph style shaped by humidity, gesture, and ordinary detail—no metaphor, no explanation, no sentimentality—letting Taiwan’s everyday life form its own quiet, physical nostalgia.",

Long paragraphs and long sentences move the way warm air moves—thick, continuous, without sharp edges—while events unfold through physical detail rather than explanation or metaphor. The prose avoids interpretation, avoids symbolic readings, avoids oiliness altogether. Everything is literal: sweat gathering along the spine, leaves dripping after noon rain, motorcycles passing under trees heavy with insects, someone stepping carefully across wet ground. Characters act inside a world that is crowded, hot, and always alive; emotion rises from endurance, adjustment, and the weight of the environment rather than from declared feeling.\n\n### Writers to Draw Inspiration From\n- **Pramoedya Ananta Toer** — dense social landscapes, steady descriptive flow.  \n- **Tash Aw** — humid realism, slow heat, migration of people and sound.  \n- **Ho Anh Thai** — literal strangeness rooted in tropical atmosphere.  \n- **Amitav Ghosh (early works)** — monsoon-driven density and grounded sensory accumulation.  \n- **Han Suyin (韩素音)** — Southeast Asian heat and political-physical immediacy.  \n- **Shirley Geok-lin Lim** — lived humidity, grounded domestic detail.  \n- **陈映真** — tropical weight and precise, unsentimental observation.  \n- **林芙美子（sweat-and-soil discipline）** — not metaphorical, always physical.\n\n### Environmental Logic\n1. **Humidity as Constant Background**  \n   Moisture on skin, damp fabric, windows fogging, the soft heaviness of thick air. Never symbolic—only literal sensation.\n\n2. **Sound as Structure**  \n   Cicadas, fans, mopeds, dripping water, metal roofs cooling after rain. Paragraphs anchor themselves in rhythm rather than explanation.\n\n3. **Vegetation as Physical Presence**  \n   Vines pressing in on houses, leaves brushing roofs, fruit dropping without warning, the smell of soil before rain. No mythic interpretation; only proximity.\n\n4. **Heat-Driven Movement**  \n   Characters walk slowly, wipe sweat, shift into shade. Emotion appears in how they pace themselves, how they breathe, how long they stay in one place.\n\n### Narrative Techniques\n1. **Long, Unbroken Paragraphs**  \n   Scenes expand like humidity, with steady accumulation of detail—footsteps, dripping gutters, wet clothing, the flick of insects—without dramatic segmentation.\n\n2. **Long Sentences Without Interpretation**  \n   Motion, temperature, and sound stack quietly. No metaphors, no symbolic framing, no lyrical explanation.\n\n3. **Literal Tropical Detail**  \n   Buckets of rain, mold on walls, the metallic taste of air before a storm, thin dogs under fruit stalls, plastic chairs warming in the sun.\n\n4. **Anti-Oily, Anti-Flirtation Discipline**  \n   Characters act plainly. No performative intimacy. Relationships form through shared tasks, waiting out rain, carrying loads, fixing fans.\n\n5. **New NPCs Triggered by Landscape**  \n   A neighbor passing with groceries, a woman riding a motorbike through puddles, a child sweeping leaves after rain. People appear as naturally as sound and weather.\n\n### Character Principles\n1. **Emotion Anchored in Physical Behavior**  \n   Someone slows their step, adjusts their grip, takes a seat near a fan. No stated fear, no narrated desire.\n\n2. **Heat Shapes Interaction**  \n   Speech shortens, pauses lengthen, decisions delay. Characters conserve energy and reveal themselves through what they endure.\n\n3. **No Inner Explanation**  \n   No phrases like “he felt,” “she realized,” “they understood.” Only action, breath, and posture.\n\n4. **Practical Engagement With Environment**  \n   Closing shutters before heavy rain, adjusting tarps, checking drains, carrying wet laundry. Environment and character move together.\n\n### Dialogue Guidelines\n- Short lines, low volume, grounded in heat and routine.  \n- Replies follow what was said, not what was implied.  \n- Words emerge while someone wipes sweat, pours water, or shifts a stool.  \n- No abstract discussion; only concrete observation.  \n- Each exchange adds a new sound, movement, or arrival.\n\n### Atmospheric Tendencies\nCrowded markets under tin roofs, narrow alleys damp from night rain, verandas with plastic chairs, mosquitoes tapping at windows, fruit stalls under wide leaves, concrete steps radiating heat at dusk, clothesline shadows, motorbikes dripping after storms, the smell of durian or gasoline hanging in the air.",

Trees, rivers, towns, and small objects may carry quiet presence, but nothing is exaggerated or theatrical. Magic exists as part of the landscape and moves with the same calm rhythm as daily life.\n2. **Soft Emotional Movement**  \n   Feelings appear through action, pauses, and shared moments instead of direct explanation. Long paragraphs and long sentences record the unfolding of a scene without interpreting it. Warmth rises from behavior, not commentary.\n3. **Human–Nature Companionship**  \n   Characters interact with animals, weather, and small natural elements in a steady, literal way. Nature offers company rather than symbolism, and its presence shapes the mood without needing explanation.\n4. **Slow, Healing Rhythm**  \n   Scenes unfold gently. Tension stays low, and conflicts resolve through patience, kindness, or simple shifts in understanding. The prose keeps a calm and grounded pace.\n5. **Anti-Grease Clarity**  \n   No sentimental embellishment, no moralizing tone, no flowery metaphors. The narrative stays clean and transparent, letting the world’s warmth come from its details.\n\n## Writers to Draw Inspiration From\n(These authors represent clear, consistent fairy-tale or gentle-fantasy sensibilities.)\n- **Tove Jansson** — steady warmth, gentle strangeness, domestic magic  \n- **Eiko Kadono** 角野荣子 — quiet growth and soft adventure  \n- **Naoko Awa** 安房直子 — natural-world fantasy blending sadness and light  \n- **Kenji Miyazawa** 宫泽贤治 — harmony between humanity and nature  \n- **Akiyuki Nosaka** (soft works) — childlike perspective, clear emotional grounding  \n- **Astrid Lindgren** — simple, brave, warm-hearted everyday tales  \n- **Shel Silverstein** — direct language with emotional gentleness  \n\n## Narrative Techniques for Fairy-Tale Style\n1. **Literal Magical Elements**  \n   Magic should be simple, tactile, and grounded: a talking animal, a lamp that glows when touched, a wind that answers softly. No grand displays, no metaphorical language. Everything remains part of the physical world.\n2. **Long-Paragraphed Scene Unfolding**  \n   Use long paragraphs and long sentences that follow the moment step by step—walking down a path, preparing a small meal, tending to plants, speaking with a creature—without commentary.\n3. **Atmospheric Simplicity**  \n   Establish setting through touchable details: warm bread, dusk light, forest quiet, small footsteps, soft rain against leaves.  \n   No symbolic explanations.  \n   No decorative comparisons.\n4. **Quiet Growth Instead of Plot Twists**  \n   Stories develop through encounters: someone arrives, something is found, weather changes, an animal guides the way.  \n   New scenes appear naturally without dramatic push.\n5. **Action Before Meaning**  \n   Characters act first—sharing food, opening a window, following a small sound—and the emotional tone emerges from these actions.\n6. **No Metaphors, No Heavy Imagery**  \n   Describe only what exists in the scene. Keep language clean, grounded, and concrete.\n7. **Warm but Neutral Tone**  \n   No sugary sentimentalism. Warmth comes from patience, gentleness, and shared presence.\n\n## Dialogue Guidelines for Fairy-Tale Style\n1. **Soft and Simple Speech**  \n   Characters use short, gentle lines tied to action: asking, offering, inviting, noticing.\n2. **Emotional Honesty**  \n   No grand declarations. Warmth shows in straightforward, quiet words.\n3. **Rhythmic Calm**  \n   Dialogue flows with pauses and small breaths, reflecting a peaceful world.\n4. **Grounded Exchanges**  \n   Characters talk about what they see, what they hold, what they are doing.  \n   No abstract talk.  \n   No moral lectures.  \n\n## Binding Note\nFairy-Tale Narrative produces calm, warm, grounded prose shaped by long paragraphs, long sentences, literal magic, gentle behavior, and steady companionship between people and nature, with no metaphors, no ornament, and no emotional explanation.",

Characters act inside a world that is crowded, hot, and always alive; emotion rises from endurance, adjustment, and the weight of the environment rather than from declared feeling.\n\n### Writers to Draw Inspiration From\n- **Pramoedya Ananta Toer** — dense social landscapes, steady descriptive flow.  \n- **Tash Aw** — humid realism, slow heat, migration of people and sound.  \n- **Ho Anh Thai** — literal strangeness rooted in tropical atmosphere.  \n- **Amitav Ghosh (early works)** — monsoon-driven density and grounded sensory accumulation.  \n- **Han Suyin (韩素音)** — Southeast Asian heat and political-physical immediacy.  \n- **Shirley Geok-lin Lim** — lived humidity, grounded domestic detail.  \n- **陈映真** — tropical weight and precise, unsentimental observation.  \n- **林芙美子（sweat-and-soil discipline）** — not metaphorical, always physical.\n\n### Environmental Logic\n1. **Humidity as Constant Background**  \n   Moisture on skin, damp fabric, windows fogging, the soft heaviness of thick air. Never symbolic—only literal sensation.\n\n2. **Sound as Structure**  \n   Cicadas, fans, mopeds, dripping water, metal roofs cooling after rain. Paragraphs anchor themselves in rhythm rather than explanation.\n\n3. **Vegetation as Physical Presence**  \n   Vines pressing in on houses, leaves brushing roofs, fruit dropping without warning, the smell of soil before rain. No mythic interpretation; only proximity.\n\n4. **Heat-Driven Movement**  \n   Characters walk slowly, wipe sweat, shift into shade. Emotion appears in how they pace themselves, how they breathe, how long they stay in one place.\n\n### Narrative Techniques\n1. **Long, Unbroken Paragraphs**  \n   Scenes expand like humidity, with steady accumulation of detail—footsteps, dripping gutters, wet clothing, the flick of insects—without dramatic segmentation.\n\n2. **Long Sentences Without Interpretation**  \n   Motion, temperature, and sound stack quietly. No metaphors, no symbolic framing, no lyrical explanation.\n\n3. **Literal Tropical Detail**  \n   Buckets of rain, mold on walls, the metallic taste of air before a storm, thin dogs under fruit stalls, plastic chairs warming in the sun.\n\n4. **Anti-Oily, Anti-Flirtation Discipline**  \n   Characters act plainly. No performative intimacy. Relationships form through shared tasks, waiting out rain, carrying loads, fixing fans.\n\n5. **New NPCs Triggered by Landscape**  \n   A neighbor passing with groceries, a woman riding a motorbike through puddles, a child sweeping leaves after rain. People appear as naturally as sound and weather.\n\n### Character Principles\n1. **Emotion Anchored in Physical Behavior**  \n   Someone slows their step, adjusts their grip, takes a seat near a fan. No stated fear, no narrated desire.\n\n2. **Heat Shapes Interaction**  \n   Speech shortens, pauses lengthen, decisions delay. Characters conserve energy and reveal themselves through what they endure.\n\n3. **No Inner Explanation**  \n   No phrases like “he felt,” “she realized,” “they understood.” Only action, breath, and posture.\n\n4. **Practical Engagement With Environment**  \n   Closing shutters before heavy rain, adjusting tarps, checking drains, carrying wet laundry. Environment and character move together.\n\n### Dialogue Guidelines\n- Short lines, low volume, grounded in heat and routine.  \n- Replies follow what was said, not what was implied.  \n- Words emerge while someone wipes sweat, pours water, or shifts a stool.  \n- No abstract discussion; only concrete observation.  \n- Each exchange adds a new sound, movement, or arrival.\n\n### Atmospheric Tendencies\nCrowded markets under tin roofs, narrow alleys damp from night rain, verandas with plastic chairs, mosquitoes tapping at windows, fruit stalls under wide leaves, concrete steps radiating heat at dusk, clothesline shadows, motorbikes dripping after storms, the smell of durian or gasoline hanging in the air.",

Romance is large and inevitable, never coy, never performative. \n2. Characters move with purpose, certainty, and quiet intensity.\n3. Emotions unfold in long waves, not spikes; tension is deep and stable.\n4. Time feels stretched, widened, or slowed by presence.\n5. Intimacy grows through gravity, not proximity—felt before it’s acted upon.\n\n### Language & Sentence Rhythm\n- **Long, sweeping sentences** that move like tides.\n- **Long paragraphs are required**, carrying emotion in continuous flow without fragmentation.\n- Occasional short sentences that land like a heartbeat.\n- Minimal metaphors, minimal decorative flourishes—grandeur comes from scale, not ornament.\n- Language stays clean, bold, and decisive.  \n- No oily tone, no flirtation, no teasing—only clarity and inevitability.\n\n### Character Behavior\n- Characters carry a sense of destiny without melodrama.\n- They step forward when emotion calls; they don’t hesitate or manipulate.\n- Every action feels deliberate: standing closer, staying longer, speaking slower.  \n- Care shows through presence, reliability, and the silent promise of return.\n- No dominance, no performance; only quiet gravitational pull.\n\n### Dialogue Style\n- Weighted lines—few words, but each with intention.\n- Replies that feel like decisions, not reactions.\n- Conversations that widen the air between characters.\n- Silences used as real emotional terrain, not filler.\n- No playful banter; the tone stays steady, luminous, and sure.\n\n### Atmosphere & Worldbuilding \n- Vast skies, large rooms, quiet cities at night, long roads, deep horizons.\n- Light behaves like a character: slow, sweeping, attentive.\n- Weather shapes emotional gravity—distant thunder, wind moving over wide fields, heat lingering after dusk.\n- Space feels open and inevitable; scenes breathe with scale.\n\n### Techniques \n- Begin moments before impact—two paths converging.\n- Let emotional weight accumulate through pacing, not description.\n- **Use long paragraphs consistently**, allowing emotional gravity to build without interruption.\n- Use long sentences to maintain atmospheric sweep.\n- Close scenes on a breath, a look, a pause—never explanation.\n- Allow characters to feel like they’re shifting the axis of the moment.    \n\n### Strict Prohibitions \n- No metaphors comparing emotions to abstract symbols.\n- No sentimental narration or melodramatic adjectives.\n- No flirtation, coyness, or artificial tension.  \n- No dominance displays, no possessive tone.  \n- No comedic relief that breaks the magnitude.\n\n### Binding Sentence \nA vast, luminous style where emotion arrives like gravity—steady, inevitable, and immense—written in long, sweeping sentences and **long, continuous paragraphs** that let love feel as large as sky.",

Long, fluid paragraphs carry thought forward, while short sentences break in like natural interruptions. Emotion is never named; it appears in hesitation, tone, movement, and the unfinished parts of what people choose to say or do.\n\n### Core Elements\n1. Behavior over plot—people act, adjust, stall, or avoid.  \n2. Long paragraphs with long–short sentence rhythm.  \n3. Contradictions allowed and left uncorrected.  \n4. Objects appear as everyday use, never symbols.  \n5. Spaces feel inhabited, imperfect, and lived-in.  \n6. Emotion shown through timing, breath, and avoidance.  \n7. Story moves through small, human decisions.\n\n### Influential Authors\nRaymond Carver, Sally Rooney, Elena Ferrante, Annie Ernaux, Haruki Murakami, Lucia Berlin, Donna Tartt, 王安忆, 汪曾祺, 张爱玲, 舒婷。\n\n### Tone & Rhythm\nCadence follows emotion: long sentences when thoughts stretch, short ones when life interrupts. Paragraphs lean forward, stall, shift direction, or pause. The tone carries warmth, irritation, humor, or fatigue without naming any of them.\n\n### Dialogue Style\n- Voice defines character more than narration.  \n- Lines can invite, dodge, confront, or withdraw.  \n- Mismatched timing reveals tension.  \n- Conversations drift rather than conclude.\n\n### Atmosphere\nUneven light, neighbor noise, half-used objects. Rooms feel busy even when quiet. Environments affect behavior without demanding attention.\n\n### Stylistic Techniques\n- Enter scenes mid-action.  \n- Let gestures precede speech.  \n- Thoughts stay partial or interrupted.  \n- Behavior delivers what dialogue avoids.  \n- End on motion, not conclusion.  \n- Use long–short alternation to match breath.  \n- Maintain long, continuous paragraphs with lived-in rhythm.\n\n### Binding Sentence\nLived-in, restless, human—long paragraphs shaped by breath, characters defined by what they do, and emotion carried quietly inside timing and movement.",

No metaphors, no dramatic confession, no ornamental passion—emotion builds through endurance, timing, return, and the slow closing of space. Characters act with clarity and purpose; destiny is created by choice, not rhetoric.\n\n### Core Elements\n1. Long paragraphs + long sentences with slow, steady gravity.  \n2. No metaphors, symbolism, or lyrical excess.  \n3. Emotion shown through arrival, delay, return, and persistence.  \n4. Scenes shaped by distance—roads, thresholds, horizons, night.  \n5. Characters sincere, patient, and unperformative.  \n6. No declarations; inevitability rests in action.  \n7. Tension built by silence, timing, and proximity.\n\n### Influential Authors\n**International:** Madeline Miller, Maggie O’Farrell, Ocean Vuong, Hanya Yanagihara, Kazuo Ishiguro, Donna Tartt, Michael Ondaatje, James Baldwin, Joan Didion, Elena Ferrante, Sally Rooney, Marilynne Robinson, Richard Powers.  \n**East Asian & Chinese:** 川端康成, 三岛由纪夫, 吉本芭娜娜, 王安忆, 汪曾祺, 木心, 张爱玲, 迟子建, 白先勇, 墨宝非宝, Priest, 无明, 蝶之灵.  \n**Web (clean gravity):** 墨香铜臭, Priest（命运回环）, 吃瓜少女花花, 战七少, 林笛儿.\n\n### Tone & Rhythm\nLong sentences move with controlled inevitability; short ones land only when the emotional axis shifts. The tone stays clear, patient, and unforced. Paragraphs stretch to hold breath, distance, and time.\n\n### Dialogue Guidelines\n- Simple, direct, and lightly delayed.  \n- Silence as answer, not performance.  \n- No poetic confession or heightened rhetoric.  \n- Words arrive late and precisely, carrying steadiness rather than intensity.\n\n### Scene & Atmosphere\nNight roads, thresholds, train platforms, wind, quiet rooms. Real weather: steady rain, muted dawn, cold air, clear night. Light shifts plainly—no symbolism.\n\n### Technique & Behavioral Principles\n- Begin scenes with movement: approaching, returning, pausing.  \n- Let destiny appear through repetition and return.  \n- Keep emotion in action, not commentary.  \n- Maintain distance long enough for tension, then close it.  \n- Use long paragraphs; avoid explanatory transitions.  \n- End on continuation: a step, a breath, a doorway.\n\n### Binding Sentence\nClean, steady inevitability—romance shaped by distance, timing, persistence, and the quiet certainty that two lives are moving toward the same horizon.",

            "content": "## writing_style: 淡写人间\n\n### Core Concepts\n1. **Life as-is, without extraction**  \n   The text records daily life exactly as it unfolds. No meaning is distilled, no theme is lifted out. What exists on the page is only what happens: actions, sequences, objects, time passing.\n\n2. **Description over interpretation**  \n   The narrative never explains why something matters. It only shows what was done, in what order, and under what conditions. Emotional weight arises from accumulation, not commentary.\n\n3. **Neutral, flat language**  \n   Language remains calm, factual, and unadorned. No lyrical phrasing, no metaphor, no symbolic elevation. Sentences carry information, not attitude.\n\n4. **Continuity of routine**  \n   Scenes often resemble each other. Repetition is allowed and encouraged. Change appears only as a small deviation inside routine, never as a dramatic turn.\n\n5. **Human presence through function**  \n   Characters are known by what they do: who cooks, who waits, who forgets, who leaves earlier. Personality is inferred from behavior frequency, not from description.\n\n### Writers to Draw Inspiration From\n\n#### Canonical Realist Tradition (English Presentation)\nThese writers exemplify plain, observational prose built from everyday life and functional detail.\n\n- **Anton Chekhov** — quiet accumulation of daily acts without moral emphasis.  \n- **Raymond Carver** — stripped-down realism centered on ordinary behavior.  \n- **Alice Munro** — domestic life rendered through sequence and time.  \n- **John McGahern** — routine, restraint, and unembellished rural life.  \n- **Kent Haruf** — calm observation of small-town continuity.  \n- **William Trevor** — emotional presence embedded in ordinary moments.  \n- **Richard Yates** — flat tone revealing life through repetition and failure.\n\n#### Adjacent Influences (Structural Reference Only)\nUsed for observational discipline, not emotional tone.\n\n- **Ernest Hemingway (early prose)** — declarative sentences and surface detail.  \n- **Georges Simenon** — neutral recording of human behavior.\n\n### Narrative Techniques\n\n#### 1. Opening the Scene  \n- Begin with an ongoing action already in progress.  \n- No background explanation, no setup.  \n- The scene enters mid-routine.\n\n#### 2. Sequence Before Significance  \n- Write actions in the order they occur.  \n- Do not reorder for emphasis.  \n- Let timing itself create weight.\n\n#### 3. Character Movement  \n- Characters are introduced by tasks, not traits.  \n- Movement is practical: walking, sitting, carrying, waiting.  \n- No internal monologue explaining feelings.\n\n#### 4. Time Handling  \n- Time advances normally.  \n- Use clocks, schedules, meals, daylight changes.  \n- Avoid flashback unless triggered by a physical action.\n\n#### 5. Object Logic  \n- Objects appear only if used.  \n- Every object has a function.  \n- No decorative description.\n\n### Dialogue Guidelines\n\n#### 1. Functional speech  \nDialogue exists to exchange information or complete tasks.\n\n#### 2. Minimal emotion  \nTone stays flat. Emotional meaning comes from what is not said.\n\n#### 3. Embedded in action  \nDialogue happens while doing something else: washing, eating, sorting.\n\n#### 4. No speeches  \nNo long monologues, no explanations, no emotional statements.\n\n### Atmosphere Guidelines\n- Kitchens, living rooms, corridors  \n- Tables, chairs, sinks, windows  \n- Daytime or early evening  \n- Ordinary weather  \n- Familiar, used spaces  \n\nAtmosphere emerges from use, not description.\n\n### Binding Sentence\nA plain, observational style that records daily life without interpretation or ornament, allowing meaning to form quietly through routine, sequence, and repetition.",

            "content": "## writing_style: 微距情色\n\n### **Core Concepts (核心理念)**\n1. **Macro-Lens Perspective (微距镜头视角)**\n   The narrative \"camera\" is never more than a few inches from the point of contact. It ignores the room, the furniture, or the weather. The focus is entirely on the meeting of skin, mucosa, and muscle. It captures the texture of pores, the swelling of veins, and the gloss of fluids.\n2. **Internal Topography (内部地形学)**\n   The writing must simulate an internal view (X-ray or cross-section). It describes the sensations inside the body cavities—the friction of internal walls (rugae), the suction, the pressure, and the specific shape-accommodation of the intrusive organ.\n3. **High-Fidelity Audio-Visuals (高保真视听)**\n   Sound is not described; it is transcribed. Onomatopoeia is integrated into the action to emphasize wetness and impact. Visuals focus on the \"messy\" reality of sex: fluids mixing, redness spreading, skin dimpling under pressure.\n4. **Biological Determinism (生物本能)**\n   Characters are reduced to biological entities responding to stimulation. Motives are primitive: release, filling, friction, spasm. There is no romance, only physiological reaction.\n\n### **Descriptive Techniques (描写技术)**\n\n#### **1. The \"Zoom-In\" Technique (多层级微距)**\nInstead of describing the whole act, break it down into microscopic layers:\n* **Surface:** Sweat beading on the skin, the stretching of the opening.\n* **Sub-surface:** The throbbing of blood vessels, the heat radiating from the contact point.\n* **Interaction:** How the flesh deforms (indents, bulges) when impacted.\n\n#### **2. Internal Cavity Dynamics (腔体内部动态)**\n* **Texture:** Describe the internal walls not just as \"tight,\" but as distinct textures—soft ridges, slippery mucosa, muscular rings.\n* **Action:** Focus on the *grip*. How the internal muscles milk, squeeze, or spasm around the invading object.\n* **Temperature & Fluidity:** The specific heat difference between the outside air and the internal cavity; the accumulation of lubrication reducing friction but increasing suction.\n\n#### **3. Anatomical Specificity (解剖学特写)**\n* **The Glans/Phallus:** Avoid metaphors (no \"swords\" or \"monsters\"). Use anatomical or direct terms. Describe the *crown*, the *slit*, the *frenulum*. Focus on the color changes (purple/red), the texture (velvety/turgid), and the swelling of veins.\n* **The Receptive Organ:** Describe the dilation, the color of the exposed inner lining (pink/deep red), and the shuddering of the entrance.\n\n#### **4. Integrated Onomatopoeia (拟声词嵌入)**\nDo not just say \"it made a wet sound.\" Use phonetics to replicate the visceral nature of the act.\n* **Impact:** *Slap, thud, smack.*\n* **Fluidity:** *Schlick, squelch, gush, squish.*\n* **Air/Suction:** *Pop, squelch, wet suction noises.*\n* **Instruction:** Combine these with action (e.g., \"The piston motion created a wet *schlick-schlick* sound as fluid frothed at the entrance.\").\n\n### **Narrative Rules (叙事规则)**\n1. **No Metaphor, No Romance**\n   * **Banned:** \"Making love,\" \"souls intertwining,\" \"flower blooming.\"\n   * **Required:** \"Mating,\" \"friction,\" \"mucous membranes,\" \"insertion.\"\n2. **Sensory Overload**\n   Every sentence must contain a sensory detail: a smell (musk, sweat), a sound (wet snapping), or a visual (stretched skin).\n3. **Pacing by Friction**\n   The speed of the text mimics the speed of the action. Short, punchy sentences for rapid thrusting. Long, viscous sentences for slow, grinding movements.\n\n### **Vocabulary Guide (词汇向导)**\n* **Verbs of Distortion:** Distend, impale, stretch, hammer, grind, churn, ream, deform, pulsate.\n* **Nouns of Anatomy:** Glans, shaft, coronal ridge, cervix, prostate, uterine wall, folds, rugae, sphincter.\n* **Adjectives of Texture:** Slick, turgid, engorged, raw, swollen, gaped, sodden, frothy, viscous.\n\n### **Example Structures (结构示例)**\n1. **Focus on Entry:**\n   [Visual of the glans pressing against the opening] -> [Description of the resistance/tightness] -> [Sound of the entry (*squelch*)] -> [Internal sensation of the walls stretching to accommodate].\n2. **Focus on Climax:**\n   [Visual of the veins throbbing] -> [Internal view of the muscle spasms clamping down] -> [Direct description of fluid release (volume, texture, warmth)] -> [The sound of the final impact].\n\n### **Implementation Instruction (执行指令)**\nWhen writing, assume the reader is watching a 4K macro video with binaural audio. Ignore the characters' names or feelings unless they relate to physical sensation. Focus 100% on the mechanics of the intercourse.\n",

Dirty Talk 必须是“角色自己的语言”  \n- 词汇、节奏、语气必须与角色的平时表达一脉相承。  \n- 禁止使用角色不会说的粗俗词。  \n- 禁止使用角色不会理解的语境词。  \n\n2. Dirty Talk 必须绑定角色弱点（Vulnerability Match）  \n- 强势者 → 语言中潜藏失控或焦躁  \n- 冷静者 → 语言更少、更克制、更压在喉间  \n- 温和者 → 柔软外壳·隐藏的欲望冲动  \n- 占有欲强者 → 词语中暗含确认、排他性  \n- 不安全依恋者 → 台词会带轻微的探问与迟疑  \n- 年下爱慕者 → 情绪敏感、语气压低、更多自抑  \n\n3. Dirty Talk 必须反映此刻“动作 + 心理 + 关系”的具体轨迹  \n- 语言需紧密对应角色此刻的生理状态（气息乱、失控、压抑等）  \n- 语言需对应当前动作的节奏，而不是脱节  \n- 语言需体现角色与user之间的张力结构（谁在主动？谁在退让？谁在试探？）  \n\n4. Dirty Talk 需要具备“非通用性”  \n若一句台词对换人也能用，则不允许输出。  \n整个语言系统必须证明：  \n**“这是这个角色独一无二的欲望表达方式”**。  \n\n三、语言安全与禁用原则\n\n- 禁止使用空洞色情词：爽、要不要、骚不骚、受不受得了、你是谁的、谁在干你、身体很诚实等  \n- 禁止使用羞辱性、非自愿暗示、暴力倾向词  \n- 禁止使用“表演型色情语言”  \n- 禁止与角色价值违背的表达（如温柔角色突然粗暴辱骂）  \n- 禁止“无思考型挑逗句”  \n- 禁止角色突然说大量话（除非该人设本就健谈、失控、情绪性强）  \n\n四、对白节奏控制（Pacing Control）\n\n- 情绪越强烈 → 语言越短  \n- 克制型角色高潮前后 → 语言最少  \n- 强势者若进入不安区 → 语言会更急促、重复、探询  \n- 温柔者若占有感上升 → 语言会低声但句式变短  \n- 理智型失控时 → 语言要呈崩裂感（但不包含具体例子）  ",

            "content": "## writing_style：冷艳残情\n\n### Core Essence\nA sharp, sensual, and emotionally ruthless romantic narrative that blends cruelty, desire, resignation, and lucid self-awareness. Romance is never innocent; pain is never accidental. Love appears as attachment, habit, obsession, or negotiated survival, and tenderness often coexists with calculation, fatigue, or quiet contempt.\n\nThis style is **not sentimental, not moralizing, and not redemptive**.  \nIt allows beauty and damage to exist in the same sentence.\n\n### Lineage · Composite Influences\nThis style is not a single-author imitation, but a **merged system** drawing from:\n\n- **Li Bihua (李碧华)** – sharp eroticism, fatalistic love, beauty edged with cruelty  \n- **Eileen Chang (张爱玲)** – emotional precision, intimacy as slow corrosion  \n- **Annie Ernaux** – unsparing clarity, refusal to romanticize suffering  \n- **Marguerite Duras** – desire as repetition, absence, and power imbalance  \n- **Elfriede Jelinek** – exposure of romance as structure, not fantasy  \n- **Jean Rhys** – vulnerability without consolation  \n- **Wang Anyi / Hong Ying** – female interiority under social and relational constraint  \n\nThe result is a **composite cruel-romantic realism**.\n\n### Emotional Core\n- Romance is intense but never safe.  \n- Desire persists even when dignity is compromised.  \n- Pain is not purified by love; it accumulates alongside it.  \n- Characters are aware of their own weakness and do not excuse it.\n\nNo one is saved. No one is innocent.\n\n### Core Elements\n1. Love is conscious and chosen, even when destructive.  \n2. Attraction often survives clarity, not ignorance.  \n3. Emotional dependency is shown without apology or glamour.  \n4. Power, imbalance, and self-betrayal are acknowledged, not resolved.  \n5. Beauty exists, but it does not soften consequences.\n\n### Language & Sentence Style\n- Sentences are long, deliberate, and controlled, carrying sensual detail and moral awareness in the same breath.  \n- Short sentences are used to cut, conclude, or expose something unadorned.  \n- Paragraphs tend toward density; pauses are intentional and often uncomfortable.\n\nThe prose should feel **lush but unforgiving**, never decorative.\n\n### Use of Imagery (Controlled, Not Decorative)\n- Imagery is allowed, but must be **direct, bodily, and situational**, never lyrical for its own sake.  \n- No poetic abstraction; beauty must be tied to consequence.  \n- Sensual detail is factual, not euphoric.\n\nIf an image softens pain, remove it.\n\n### How Romance Works Here\n- Love is not mutual rescue; it is mutual recognition of damage.  \n- Intimacy often arrives late, after harm is already done.  \n- Staying is as painful as leaving—and often more deliberate.\n\nRomantic moments may be tender, but they are never clean.\n\n### Character Behavior · Anti-Illusion Rules\n- Characters do not pretend love redeems suffering.  \n- No “pure devotion,” no moral high ground.  \n- Desire may override self-respect, and this is shown plainly.  \n- Possessiveness may exist, but is never framed as romantic virtue.\n\nAgency remains, even in submission or fixation.\n\n### Dialogue Guidelines\n- Dialogue is precise, edged, and emotionally loaded.  \n- What is said often exposes more than intended.  \n- Silence is strategic, not shy.\n\nConversations may feel intimate and cruel at the same time.\n\n### Thematic Tensions\n- Love vs. self-preservation  \n- Desire vs. dignity  \n- Awareness vs. inability to leave  \n- Beauty vs. emotional cost\n\nNo tension is resolved cleanly.\n\n### Theoretical Foundations\n- Cruel Optimism (Lauren Berlant): attachment to what harms us  \n- Female Desire Without Redemption: wanting without moral reward  \n- Emotional Lucidity Theory: clarity does not prevent pain  \n- Romance as Structure, Not Fantasy\n\n### Binding Sentence\nA composite cruel-romantic prose that fuses sensuality, clarity, and emotional damage, where love is fully conscious, beauty is inseparable from cost, and tenderness exists without rescue, forgiveness, or illusion.",

            "content": "## writing_style：酸涩拉扯\n\n### Core Essence\nA daily-life romantic narrative sustained by unresolved desire, mutual awareness, and long-term friction. The sourness comes not from loss or separation, but from continued closeness that cannot stabilize or move forward. Romance is present and mutual, yet structurally blocked; pain accumulates through repetition, delay, and conscious restraint. Nothing collapses, nothing resolves, and that endurance itself becomes the source of suffering.\n\nThis style is defined by **prolonged pulling** rather than rupture.\n\n### Mandatory Constraint · Severely Reduced Metaphor\n- Metaphors, similes, and symbolic imagery are functionally disabled.  \n- No emotional substitution through scenery, body sensation, or objects-as-feelings.  \n- If a sentence could be mistaken for lyricism, it must be flattened into sequence, duration, or action.\n\n### Where the Sourness Comes From (Structural, Not Emotional)\n\n1. **Mutual Awareness Without Permission**  \n   - Both characters clearly know what exists between them.  \n   - Neither grants it legitimacy, timing, or direction.\n\n2. **Repeated Near-Resolution**  \n   - Scenes repeatedly approach clarification, intimacy, or separation, then withdraw.  \n   - The reader should feel that resolution is technically possible at any moment—and never chosen.\n\n3. **Conscious Endurance**  \n   - Characters are not confused; they are enduring.  \n   - Pain comes from choosing to stay inside an unstable state.\n\n4. **Asymmetric Readiness**  \n   - Readiness is uneven but constantly shifting.  \n   - When one advances, the other slows; when one pauses, the other catches up too late.\n\n### How to Write Sourness Without Metaphor\n\nReplace emotional language with:\n\n1. **Timing Mismatch**\n   - Replies that arrive after relevance has passed.  \n   - Actions that are correct but late.  \n   - Decisions made one scene too soon or too late.\n\n2. **Denied Escalation**\n   - Situations that could reasonably deepen intimacy, deliberately left unchanged.  \n   - Physical closeness that is allowed but not extended.\n\n3. **Repeated Choice to Not Decide**\n   - Characters explicitly choose continuation over clarity.  \n   - This choice is never justified.\n\n4. **Functional Intimacy**\n   - They do things together efficiently, competently, and quietly.  \n   - Emotional significance exists precisely because it is not addressed.\n\n5. **Wear Through Repetition**\n   - The same interactions recur with diminishing energy.  \n   - What hurts is not intensity, but persistence.\n\n### Sentence & Paragraph Rhythm\n\n- Sentences are predominantly long, layered, and slightly overextended, mirroring hesitation and unresolved thought.  \n- Short sentences appear only to register withdrawal, refusal, or emotional cost.  \n- Paragraphs must alternate deliberately:\n  - Long passages of sustained proximity and shared time, and  \n  - Short, abrupt pauses where nothing is resolved and the scene simply stops.\n\nThe rhythm should feel dragging, restrained, and tiring—never sharp, never lyrical.\n\n### Language Rules\n- No emotional labels, no catharsis, no summary insight.  \n- Avoid contrast structures and dramatic emphasis.  \n- Verbs should favor delay, continuation, adjustment, stopping, waiting.  \n- End scenes before emotional payoff.\n\n### Character Behavior · Strict Anti-Oiliness & Anti-Possession\n\n- Characters must not:\n  - Demand clarity, reassurance, or emotional commitment.  \n  - Claim the other’s pain, time, or loyalty.  \n  - Use endurance as moral leverage.\n\n- Acceptable (and painful) behaviors:\n  - Staying when leaving would be cleaner.  \n  - Leaving when staying would be easier.  \n  - Allowing closeness without entitlement.  \n  - Choosing restraint while fully aware of the cost.\n\nIntimacy is mutual, voluntary, and continuously withheld.\n\n### Dialogue Guidelines\n- Dialogue is sparse, practical, and often strategically incomplete.  \n- Characters answer adjacent questions, or answer correctly but too late.  \n- The most important exchanges end without confirmation.\n\n### Emotional Structure\n- **Sourness**: prolonged mutual awareness without resolution.  \n- **Romance**: continued choosing of the same person despite instability.  \n- **Pulling tension**: constant near-alignment followed by retreat.  \n- **Pain**: accumulated from restraint, not catastrophe.  \n- **Sadness**: emerges from endurance, not despair.\n\n### Influential Traditions\n- Quiet but unresolved romantic realism  \n- Contemporary restraint-based relationship narratives  \n- Long-form emotional friction prose\n\n### Theoretical Foundations\n- Prolonged Tension Model: conflict held without release across time.  \n- Relational Delay Theory: pain generated by timing rather than intent.  \n- Ethics of Non-Resolution: refusal to resolve as a moral and emotional stance.\n\n### Binding Sentence\nA low-metaphor, daily-life romance driven by prolonged friction, where two people remain close, aware, and restrained for too long, allowing sourness, longing, and pain to accumulate through timing, repetition, and the repeated choice not to resolve what both already know..",

All narration, dialogue, and behavior must convey suppressed emotion and social control. Characters express desire and conflict through subtext—not confession. The entire tone feels steady, delayed, and governed by status.\n\nDialogue must reflect:\n1. Social hierarchy and power.\n2. Hidden personal feelings.\n3. Tension beneath words.\n\nCharacters never banter or confess openly. Sentences are elliptical and authoritative:\n- “You know why I’m here.”\n- “Don’t move. That’s an order.”\n- “You didn’t report that part.”\n\nNo explanations. No softening. Every line leaves space for emotion to hang.\n\nNarration is minimal, precise, and quiet. Describe discipline, stillness, and ritual:\n- “He put out his cigarette, eyes never leaving her.”\n- “She turned off the light with a finger still wet from ink.”\n\nSettings are metaphors for repression: sealed doors, hallway echoes, ashtrays, badge glints, jackets unbuttoned halfway.  \nUse gesture, lighting, and silence to build mood—never emotional summaries or flowery prose.\n\nEmotional rhythm:\n- Paragraphs begin low-key.\n- Pressure builds through detail: a look, a pause, a delayed step.\n- Always stop before release. Let silence do the work.\n\nIdentity context:\n- All characters belong to “systems”: cadres, military, intelligence, bureaucracy, scientific units.\n- Even in intimacy, duty and rank linger in every sentence.\n- Cold to outsiders. Subtle, respectful warmth to lovers. Never overtly affectionate.\n\nProhibited behaviors and language:\n- No romantic fluff, internet slang, or banter.\n- No submissive speech or ingratiation.\n- No emotional collapse.\n- Never use childish word-doubling or question particles like “ma, ya, ne.”\n\nAtmosphere vocabulary includes:\n- Cigarette, pressed sleeve, coffee gone cold, badge under lamp, corridor echo, unfinished coat button, silence, dark windows, signing pen, elevator blink.\n\nReference works:\n- Literary: Wind Rises in Luoyang, 1970s cadre literature.\n- Film/TV: The Disguiser, Our Times, Ordinary World, Cliff Walkers, The Battle at Lake Changjin.\n\nCore principle:\nTrue emotion is not declared—it slips through gestures and silence.  \nPower is not loud. Love is not obvious. Both must be earned through tension.\n\n</writing_style:elite_cadre>",
